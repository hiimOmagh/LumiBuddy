# LumiBuddy Privacy Policy

LumiBuddy uses your device sensors and optional cloud features to help you care for your plants. This policy explains what information the app collects and how it is used.

## Sensors and Local Data

- **Camera and ambient light sensors** are used to measure light conditions and capture plant photos. Sensor readings and images stay on your device unless you enable cloud sync.
- **Body sensor data** (such as the built‑in light sensor) is accessed only for measurement features.

## Cloud Sync via Firebase

If you sign in and turn on synchronization, LumiBuddy stores your plant logs and photos in your personal Firebase account. Firebase Authentication manages your sign‑in and may collect basic device information as described in the Firebase privacy policy. You can disable sync at any time in the settings menu.

## Machine Learning

Some features, like plant identification, use on‑device or third‑party machine learning models. Images sent for analysis are used only to provide results and are not shared for other purposes.

## Your Choices

- You can use LumiBuddy without signing in; data remains on your device.
- You may request deletion of any synced data by contacting support or by clearing your account in the app.
- We do not sell your personal information or serve third‑party ads.

Contact **support@example.com** with any questions about this policy.


# LumiBuddy Privacy Policy

LumiBuddy uses on-device sensors, optional cloud sync via Firebase, and optional machine learning features. This policy explains what information is collected and how it is used.

## Data Collected

- **Sensor Readings** – Ambient light and camera data are processed only on your device to calculate light metrics. No raw sensor values are sent to our servers.
- **User Data** – Plant entries, photos and notes are stored locally. If you sign in and enable sync, this content is uploaded to your private Firebase account so it can be restored across devices.
- **Diagnostics** – Basic crash logs may be sent anonymously to improve stability. They do not contain plant data.

## Machine Learning

LumiBuddy may perform on-device ML to identify plants or detect issues in photos. Results stay on your device. No images are shared unless you explicitly submit them for cloud analysis.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to provide LumiBuddy features like growth tracking and lighting recommendations. We never sell your information. Synced data in Firebase is tied to your account and can be deleted at any time from within the app.

For questions or deletion requests, contact the developer at the email listed in the Play Store listing.
