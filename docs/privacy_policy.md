# LumiBuddy Privacy Policy

LumiBuddy uses on-device sensors, optional cloud sync via Firebase, and optional machine learning
features. This policy explains what information is collected and how it is used.

## Data Collected

- **Sensor Readings** – Ambient light and camera data are processed only on your device to calculate
  light metrics. No raw sensor values are sent to our servers.
- **User Data** – Plant entries, photos and notes are stored locally. If you sign in and enable
  sync, this content is uploaded to your private Firebase account so it can be restored across
  devices.
- **Diagnostics** – Basic crash logs may be sent anonymously to improve stability. They do not
  contain plant data.

## Machine Learning

LumiBuddy may perform on-device ML to identify plants or detect issues in photos. Results stay on
your device. No images are shared unless you explicitly submit them for cloud analysis.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to provide LumiBuddy features like growth tracking and lighting
recommendations. We never sell your information. Synced data in Firebase is tied to your account and
can be deleted at any time from within the app.

For questions or deletion requests, contact the developer at the email listed in the Play Store
listing.
