## Project Vision

LumiBud aims to **demystify indoor plant care**, putting expert-level light/environment analysis and plant-specific recommendations in every grower‚Äôs pocket ‚Äì whether they use only their phone or add advanced sensors and AI.

---

## App Architecture

### Key Principles

- **Feature modularization** for clean separation, testability, and scalability.
- **MVVM/Clean Architecture**: ViewModels, repositories, data abstraction.
- **Dependency injection** for swappable components.
- **Pluggable sensor sources** (phone, Bluetooth, USB, cloud, etc).
- **Interfaces for AR and ML modules** (can be stubbed at first, plugged in later).
- **Room database** for user/plant/care/event storage.
- **Abstracted network/API layer** for plant/lamp DBs, cloud sync, etc.
- **All logic unit-testable and UI-independent.**

## Measurement Science & Algorithms

### Key Metrics
- **Lux (Illuminance)**: Measured via ALS or camera.
- **Foot-candles**: Optional imperial unit (1 fc = 10.764 lux).
- **PPFD (Œºmol/m¬≤/s)**: Core metric for plant photosynthesis.
- **DLI (mol/m¬≤/day)**: Total plant-usable light per day.
- **CCT (Kelvin)**: Color temperature.
- **Spectrum**: R/G/B proportion; spectrum type auto-identified or manually selected.

### Algorithms/Approach

- **ALS (Ambient Light Sensor):** Direct lux reading; spectrum-dependent conversion to PPFD.
- **Camera + Diffuser:** Average RGB, spectrum heuristics, per-lamp calibration factor or user-supplied calibration.
- **Calibration:** Per-device, per-lamp, user-adjustable profiles; supports custom reference (sun, meter, manufacturer).
- **Periodic logging:** For DLI and environment tracking.
- **Spectral heuristics:** Rule-based RGB analysis for light type (Bluer, Redder, Full-spectrum, etc).

### Modular Input Source Design

- All measurements via `LightMeasurementSource` interface (phone, BLE, USB, IoT, etc).
- Easy to extend for hardware with minimal core code changes.

---

## Plant Database & Care Recommendation System

- **Plant ID:** AI photo recognition (ML Kit, PlantID API), manual search/list as fallback.
- **Plant DB:** Optimal DLI, PPFD, temp, humidity, watering by species/stage.
- **Diary:** Growth scans, photos, measurements, notes, interventions.
- **Care Recommendation Engine:** Matches logs/measurements to plant needs; gives user actionable, stage-specific advice.
- **Watering/Fertilizer Scheduler:** Dynamic reminders, rescheduling based on log entries.

---

## Grow Light Product Integration

- **Auto-ID:** Scan/search lamp brand/model/barcode or take photo; fetch lamp specs from DB/online.
- **Manual Entry:** User can specify lamp type, spectrum, wattage, PPFD at distance.
- **Calibration:** Each lamp/profile can have unique calibration factor.

---

## Modular Design for AR, ML, and Hardware

- **AR Module:** Overlays for live measurement, growth alignment, plant care suggestions (via ARCore or compatible tech).
- **ML Module:** Plant/lamp recognition, health status detection (modular, replaceable, updatable as tech advances).
- **External Hardware Module:** Bluetooth/USB/IoT sensors; plug-and-play via interface and HardwareManager.

    String calibrationProfileId;
}
Development Plan / Roadmap
Project foundation: App skeleton, navigation, MVVM, Room DB

Measurement MVP: ALS/camera/diffuser, core metric display

Plant DB/Diary: Plant add/ID/search, care DB, logs, timeline/calendar

Grow light/lamp integration: Search/scan/manual entry, calibration manager

Care recommendations & reminders: Scheduler, notifications

UI/UX polish: Modern dashboard, diary, photo comparison

AR/ML stubs: Placeholders for future overlays/recognition

Hardware modularization: Interface and code for external sensor expansion

Advanced features: AR overlays, ML health/plant/lamp recognition, cloud sync, export/import

Contribution Guidelines
Keep all new features modular (new package/module per major feature)

Use interfaces for all external services (easy to mock/replace)

Document all new public methods and data flows

Write and run unit tests for each feature

Update README with all major changes or planned extensions
